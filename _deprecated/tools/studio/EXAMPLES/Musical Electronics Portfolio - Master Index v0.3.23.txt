0.0 META
------------------------------------------------------------

0.1 Purpose
    * Track the musical electronics projects you are carrying:
        - Active development
        - Legacy / reference
        - Long-term "maybe someday" R&D
    * Keep all projects in a unified list, but mark each with CATEGORY TAGS:
        - Example tags: Instrument, Effect, Noise Synth, Electro-Acoustic,
          Microphone, Monitoring, Fuzz, Formant, Resonator, Hybrid, etc.
    * Provide a single place to decide "what deserves attention next?"

0.2 Status Codes

        SPEC          = Has goals plus rough block diagram.
        MDBD_DRAFT    = MDBD started but missing major pieces
                        (for example, full netlist, BOM, or sections).
        MDBD_FULL     = MDBD includes overview, blocks, BOM, and pin-level
                        netlist sufficient to build from.

1.0 ACTIVE PROJECTS (UNIFIED LIST WITH CATEGORY TAGS)
------------------------------------------------------------

1.1 Phantom Engine Mk4
    ID: PE-MK4
    Project Status: ACTIVE (core build)
    Category Tags:
        * Instrument
        * Noise Synth
        * Effect
    Role / Niche:
        * Guitar-reactive noise-swell synth that swells a filtered noise bed
          under your playing, with LFO or EXP movement and clean or drone mix.
        * Intended as a live-safe noise instrument once tuned: dynamic but
          predictable behavior suitable for performance.
    Design Status:
        * MDBD_FULL, DESIGN_FROZEN for v4.0.23.
        * Current MDBD: Phantom Engine Mk4.0.23.
    Build Status:
        * UNBUILT - awaiting first prototype and voicing.
    EXP / CV:
        * Yes. Expression or CV input drives the filter vactrols, sweeping
          cutoff. Shares the modulation role with the LFO for moving the
          noise bed.
    Notes:
        * Flagship Phantom Engine build. Any new ideas are parked for future
          revisions, not this frozen spec.

1.2 Phantom Engine Lite
    ID: PE-LT
    Project Status: ACTIVE
    Category Tags:
        * Instrument
        * Noise Synth
        * Effect
    Role / Niche:
        * Streamlined sibling to Phantom Engine Mk4: a guitar-reactive,
          all-analog noise-swell pedal using a single zener-based noise
          source, envelope-driven vactrol VCA, and clean + drone mix, with
          all noise tone control handed to a passive expression pedal.
        * Designed as a simpler, easier-to-build live-safe noise instrument
          based on the Phantom Engine architecture.
    Design Status:
        * MDBD_FULL – Phantom Engine Lite Mk 1.0 MDBD v1.0.7
          (zener noise + standard passive EXP).
    Build Status:
        * UNBUILT – first perfboard or stripboard prototype is next.
    EXP / CV:
        * Yes – 1/4" TRS EXP jack (J2) for a normal passive expression pedal:
            - Sleeve = ground.
            - Ring   = DC reference at about VREF via 1 k resistor.
            - Tip    = wiper voltage (0 V to ~VREF depending on pedal position).
        * Internally, EXP drives JFET J1 as a voltage-controlled series
          resistor into C7, forming a one-pole lowpass:
            - Heel: higher resistance, lower cutoff → darker noise.
            - Toe:  lower resistance, higher cutoff → brighter noise.
        * No panel Color knob: the expression pedal is the sole tone control
          for the noise spectrum.
        * J2 is not a CV or audio jack:
            - It should only see a passive EXP pot (≈10 k–50 k).
            - Active CV sources or audio are not to be connected here.
    Notes:
        * Single vactrol U1 as a series VCA in the noise path, LED driven
          purely from ENVELOPE_CV by Q1; no manual floor control.
        * Noise path: 6.8 V zener at +9V_PROT via R18, AC-coupled through C6,
          biased to VREF, then modest gain and HF shaping via IC1B.
        * Supply: 9 V DC pedalboard supply, with allowed range 8–12 V and
          current target <25 mA; TLE2426 provides VREF midrail.

              wiper/CV via series resistor; Sleeve = ground.
            - Tip clamped 0–5 V by Schottky clamp.
            - With no plug, HAND pot is normalized into this path as manual
              macro control; MORPH crossfades between ENV and EXP/HAND.
        * SC IN (J4):
            - AUDIO mode: sidechain audio into detector, 0–3 V envelope.
            - CV mode: 0–3 V DC CV, bypassing detector timing.
        * CTRL OUT (J5):
            - Buffered 0–3 V envelope output with protection, designed to

3.3 Vibradrone v1.3-ENV (Rev B) – Six-String Electro-Acoustic Zither
    ID: VIB-1
    Project Status: RND_LONG (experimental reference design)
    Category Tags:
        * Instrument
        * Electro-Acoustic
        * Sustain / Drone
        * Experimental
    Role / Niche:
        * Six-string electro-acoustic string reverb/zither with a rail
          pickup, active front-end, and a magnetic driver coil that sustains
          the strings to create a controllable drone pad. Can follow real
          guitar playing via the sensor path or be excited from an internal
          oscillator, with LFO-modulated tone and envelope-based swell.
    Design Status:
        * MDBD_FULL – Vibradrone v1.3-ENV Rev B Project Design Document
          (build-ready reference with stability, hum immunity, and robustness
          updates).
    Build Status:
        * UNBUILT in this index – document includes bring-up and
          troubleshooting procedures, but no completed unit is recorded here.
    EXP / CV:
        * 1/4" TRS EXP jack:
            - Sleeve = GND.
            - Ring   = reference node via ~220 Ω.
            - Tip    = wiper, also via ~220 Ω when hitting biased nodes.
        * Expression assignment:
            - INTENSITY: EXP voltage is padded into the gain/Intensity
              control node to shape how much the envelope boosts driver level.
            - PITCH:     EXP modifies the oscillator RC via series resistor
                         and zener clamp, changing driver frequency rather
                         than level.
        * Taper-shaping:
            - 10–22 k from EXP wiper to ground recommended to smooth travel.
        * Safety / limits:
            - EXP never drives the BTL amp’s VC/mute node; it is confined to
              modulation of pre-driver intensity or oscillator pitch.
    Notes:
        * Power: 6xAA NiMH pack (nominal 7.2 V, ~8.4 V fresh), protection and
          VREF for small-signal stages, low-V indicator around 6.6–6.8 V.
        * Core path: sensor pickup → buffer → source select (guitar/osc) →
          pre-driver → vactrol LPF → BTL amp → blade driver → strings.
        * Control loop: feedback from sensor buffer with HPF + trim back into
          pre-driver; envelope follower and vactrol across gain resistor.

3.4 SM-1 – Sonic Mirage
    ID: SM-1
    Project Status: RND_LONG (“maybe someday”)
    Category Tags:
        * Instrument
        * Electro-Acoustic
        * Resonator
        * Reverb-ish
    Role / Niche:
        * Electro-acoustic resonator / “reverb box” using tines or similar
          mechanical elements driven by an actuator and sensed by pickups,
          producing shimmering, evolving tails and physical ambience.
    Design Status:
        * MDBD_FULL – Sonic Mirage MDBD v1.0.13.
    Build Status:
        * UNBUILT – intentionally parked as a future “boss” build.
    EXP / CV:
        * Yes. TRS EXP input, switch-selected with ENV_OUT as the control
          source for solenoid/tension drive.
    Notes:
        * Moved from ACTIVE to RND_LONG to reduce current load on your
          project queue while preserving it as a major future
          electro-acoustic flagship target.

3.5 SS1 – The Semantic Sequencer
    ID: SS1
    Project Status: RND_LONG (workshopped architecture)
    Category Tags:
        * Instrument
        * Controller
        * Hybrid Digital/Analog
        * ML / Generative
    Role / Niche:
        * Standalone “bicameral” instrument that converts natural-language
          instructions (via phone or tablet) into structured JSON, then into
          deterministic audio, MIDI, and CV/gate using an embedded engine.
        * Designed to act as a conductor for both internal engines
          (SAM2695 + Daisy) and external synths.
    Design Status:
        * MDBD_DRAFT – SS1 Architecture v0.3:
            - Three-node topology:
                • Node A: phone/tablet for STT and UI.
                • Node B: Raspberry Pi 5 running a local Student SLM with
                  grammar-enforced JSON output.
                • Node C: embedded performance engine (Daisy Seed + SAM2695)
                  generating audio, MIDI, and CV/gate.
            - “Academy” pipeline:
                • Teacher model in the cloud (large LLM on rented GPU) to
                  generate prompt→JSON dataset.
                • Student SLM fine-tuned locally (RTX 3060) via Unsloth or
                  equivalent tools.
                • Future Teacher in-house (e.g. Tesla P40 on X99) to remove
                  cloud dependency.
            - Functional requirements for:
                • Stereo audio out (Daisy + SAM mix).
                • MIDI out.
                • ≈4 CV outs (0–5 V, including at least one 1 V/oct pitch CV).
                • ≈4 gate outs (~5 V logic) for note/gate/trigger signals.
            - No component-level schematic, BOM, or netlist yet.
    Build Status:
        * UNBUILT – no physical prototype defined in this doc.
    EXP / CV:
        * Extensive CV/gate planned:
            - Multiple CV outputs (0–5 V) for pitch, modulation, and macros.
            - Multiple gate/trigger outputs (~5 V) for rhythm and events.
        * Primary “expression” is via natural-language control + MIDI/CV
          outputs, not a pedal EXP jack.
    Notes:
        * Node C (Daisy) is the timing master; SLM latency is allowed to be
          seconds as long as audio never glitches.
        * Clear separation of concerns:
            - Node A: STT & UI.
            - Node B: semantic mapping to JSON.
            - Node C: deterministic, clocked performance environment.
        * Uses your “Bridge” and “Academy” concepts as a template for other
          hybrid AI + hardware instruments.

5.1 MDBDs Going Forward
    * When you paste or upload an MDBD in this space and say
      "Treat this as the current MDBD for [ID]", I will:
        - Update that project's design and build status.
        - Record EXP or CV behavior explicitly.
        - Keep the project summary aligned with the document.
    * Circuit-level critique happens in separate engineering sessions.

5.2 How to Use This Index
    * Use this file to:
        - Choose which core builds to prototype next.
        - See each project's CATEGORY TAGS at a glance.
        - Offload long-term ideas so they stop soaking mental bandwidth.
