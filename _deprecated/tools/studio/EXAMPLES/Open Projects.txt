Eric's Open Projects List
Project 1: Repair 3D Printer (Ender 3 Pro)
Project Status: Stopped ~3 years ago. A new, working replacement mainboard is on-hand. Original failure point was difficulty flashing Marlin firmware to support an ABL (Auto Bed Leveling) device.

Task Breakdown (Refined):

Re-familiarize with the project state.

Physically install the new replacement mainboard.

Compile, flash, troubleshoot, and debug the Marlin firmware (specifically for ABL support).

Test all hardware (axes, heaters, extruder).

Calibrate ABL and run test prints.

Estimates:

Total Time: 8 - 11 hours (2-3 for hardware, 6-8 for software/troubleshooting).

Duration: 1 - 2 active days.

Intrusiveness: Level 1 (Rationale: It has its own station and is not blocking other work.)

Project 2: Rebuild Kustom brand amp
Project Status: Disassembled after a major flood. Case is fully repaired and refinished. Electronics are ~35 years old (solid state) and may need recapping. Currently in pieces in the living room.

Task Breakdown (Phase 1: Best-Case Reassembly):

Clean, dry, and grease all corroded hardware (using ultrasonic cleaner for the first time).

Clean and test original reverb tank.

Purchase new reverb bag (if tank works) or replacement tank (if it fails).

Reassemble all components into the refinished cabinet.

Full function test.

Task Breakdown (Phase 2: Contingency Plan):

If amp fails test or for future reliability: full recap (diagnose, source, and replace all electrolytic capacitors).

Estimates (Phase 1):

Total Time: ~6-8 hours (4-6 hours for cleaning hardware + 2 hours for reassembly).

Duration: ~2 active days.

Intrusiveness: Level 4 (Rationale: High priority. Parts are in the living room, impeding shared space.)

Estimates (Phase 2 - Contingency):

Total Time: 10-15+ hours (Beginner soldering, research, careful board removal).

Duration: 3-5 active days.

Project 3: Fix 1977 Fender Stratocaster
Project Status: Disassembled. Needs rewiring (new switch, fix pickup wiring, proper ground). Frets polished. Aftermarket saddles align poorly.

Parts on Hand: Replacement Callaham stainless steel saddles.

Task Breakdown (Phase 1: Main Repair & Assembly):

Source new main switch.

Rewire pickguard (new switch, pickups, ground).

Install new Callaham saddles.

Reassemble entire guitar.

String, adjust, and intonate.

Task Breakdown (Phase 2: Contingency Plan):

If nut is bad, replace it (new skill).

Estimates (Phase 1):

Total Time: 6 - 7 hours.

Duration: 1 active day.

Estimates (Phase 2 - Contingency):

Total Time: 1 - 2 additional hours.

Intrusiveness: Level 4 (Rationale: Pickguard and parts have been on the workbench for over two months.)

Project 4: Upgrade main computer
Project Status: Components (new CPU, NVME, SSD) are on-hand for ~2 years. Proficient, but hesitant about CPU swap.

Task Breakdown:

Cloning (Passive): Clone existing NVME drive. Clone SSD (if SATA budget is insufficient).

Hardware Install (Active):

Perform full case cleaning.

Replace CPU (requires new thermal paste).

Install new/cloned NVME.

Swap HDDs between external/internal.

Install/replace SSD.

Testing: Boot and confirm all new hardware.

Estimates:

Total Time: ~7-9+ hours (Active: ~3 hours / Passive: ~4-6+ hours for cloning).

Duration: 1-2 active days.

Intrusiveness: Level 2 (Rationale: Parts are not physically in the way, but the lack of storage is a workflow impediment.)

Project 5: Refinish/fix bookshelf
Project Status: Flood-damaged. 95% sanded. Stuck on final 5% of sanding. Structural/mold work is done.

Task Breakdown:

Complete final 5% of sanding (difficult corners).

Apply pre-stain conditioner.

Apply stain.

Apply multiple coats of oil-based polyurethane (requires ~3-day dry times between coats).

Allow for final, full cure.

Estimates:

Total Active Time: ~10-11 hours (4-5 for sanding + 6 for coating).

Total Calendar Duration: ~6 weeks (due to long drying/curing times).

Intrusiveness: Level 5 (Highest Priority)

Rationale: Project is in a shared shed needed for a partner's art show in late December. It is a "particular point of contention" and a source of relationship stress.

Project 6: Fix/clean/sanitize dresser
Project Status: A "twice second hand" piece that has sat empty for 2 years as it requires deep cleaning and sanitization before use.

Primary Goal: Clean/sanitize the dresser (especially unfinished interiors) so it can be used, clearing clothes from around the house. A full refinish is a future project.

Task Breakdown:

Clean/vacuum all interior/exterior surfaces.

Sanitize unfinished interiors with a 10% bleach solution.

Allow to dry completely (1-2 days).

Lightly sand unfinished interiors to smooth any raised grain.

Final vacuum/wipe-down.

Estimates:

Total Active Time: 6 - 8 hours.

Total Calendar Duration: 2 - 3 active days (to allow for drying).

Intrusiveness: Level 5 (Highest Priority)

Rationale (Physical): The consequence (piled-up clothes) is a major physical impediment.

Rationale (Relational): A major "point of contention" with your partner.

Project 7: Set up second "server" PC
Project Status: The PC is functional and physically in place, but not connected.

Primary Goal: Set up the PC as a media center.

Blocker (The Real Project): The area behind the heavy TV console is contaminated with old mouse droppings from a past infestation. This must be cleaned before you are comfortable running wires.

Task Breakdown:

Empty the TV console completely (TV, all other items).

Move the heavy console away from the wall.

Thoroughly clean the area (vacuum droppings, sanitize).

Wet-vac the area rug that sits under the console.

Allow the rug to dry outside for ~2 days (weather dependent).

Upgrade the nearby electrical outlet to ensure a proper ground.

Move the console and all items back into place.

Finally, plug in the PC and run the wires through the clean area.

Estimates:

Total Active Time: ~8 hours.

Total Calendar Duration: ~3 active days (to allow for rug drying).

Intrusiveness: Level 2

Rationale: The PC itself is not physically in the way, but its state of disuse (becoming obsolete, wasting resources) is a source of frustration.
