## 3.0 Bill of Materials (BOM)

> **Note:** This must be kept in sync with 4.0 Netlist / topology. Any change here must be reflected there, and vice versa.

* 3.1 BOM Table (Core Components):

| RefDes | Quantity | Value / Part Number | Description                 | Package | Notes                          |
|--------|----------|---------------------|-----------------------------|---------|--------------------------------|
| R1     | 1        | [Value]             | [e.g., Input resistor]      | [pkg]   | [Tolerance, power rating, etc] |
| R2     | 1        | [Value]             |                             |         |                                |
| C1     | 1        | [Value]             | [e.g., Coupling cap]        | [pkg]   | [Voltage rating, type]         |
| U1     | 1        | [Part Number]       | [e.g., Op-amp, micro, etc.] | [pkg]   | [Key characteristics]          |
