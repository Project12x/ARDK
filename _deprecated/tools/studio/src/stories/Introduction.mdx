# Welcome to Workshop.OS Design System

This Storybook documents the UI components and design system for the Workshop.OS application.
It is built using **Radix UI** primitives for accessibility and logic, styled with **Tailwind CSS**, and uses **Framer Motion** for animations.

## Core Principles

- **Accessibility First**: All components are built on top of Radix UI primitives to ensure full WAI-ARIA compliance.
- **Composition**: Components are designed to be composed together to build complex UIs.
- **Theming**: The design system relies on CSS variables and Tailwind configuration for consistent theming.

## Getting Started

Explore the components in the sidebar to see examples of how to use them.
