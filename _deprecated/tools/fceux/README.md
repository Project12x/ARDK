# FCEUX - Alternative NES Emulator

Legacy NES emulator with Lua scripting support.

## When to Use

- Compatibility testing with different emulation behavior
- Using existing FCEUX Lua scripts
- TAS (Tool-Assisted Speedrun) development

## Installation

Download from: https://fceux.com/

## Limitations

- No headless mode (cannot integrate with CI/CD)
- Less accurate than Mesen
- Different Lua API than Mesen

## Notes

For ARDK development, **Mesen is recommended** due to headless test runner support.
