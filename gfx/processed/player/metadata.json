    "notes": "The sprite sheet features a consistent 32x32 pixel player character. Each animation sequence (Idle, Run, Shoot) is laid out horizontally, with a 32-pixel transparent gap between individual 32x32 frames. The palette is limited to four distinct colors: magenta, cyan, white, and black, which aligns with NES hardware sprite limitations (each 8x8 hardware sprite can use one of 4 palettes, each palette having 3 colors plus a transparent color, and the background color being shared). The character is likely composed of multiple 8x8 or 8x16 hardware sprites to achieve the 32x32 logical size.",
