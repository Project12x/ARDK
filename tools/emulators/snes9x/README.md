# Snes9x - SNES Emulator

For future SNES HAL tier development (HAL_TIER_STANDARD).

## Installation

Download from: https://www.snes9x.com/

## Future Use

When ARDK expands to support SNES:
- HAL_TIER_STANDARD (SNES/Genesis capability level)
- Mode 7 testing
- HDMA effects
- SPC700 audio

## Alternative: Mesen 2

Mesen 2 also supports SNES with the same Lua API as NES,
making it easier to share test infrastructure.
